# BearTheBeer

This modern beer shopping platform is a high-performance web application built using **React** for dynamic and responsive user interfaces and **SCSS** for maintainable and scalable styling. The backend infrastructure is supported by **AWS S3** for efficient data storage and **CDNs** to deliver images and JSON data swiftly, ensuring optimized loading times.

1. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Integrated a secure login service using **Express** to authenticate users and protect all routes.  
   - Ensured that user sessions are managed safely to maintain data integrity.

2. **Enhanced Performance**:
   - Implemented **lazy loading** to load assets and components on demand, reducing initial load time and improving Core Web Vitals metrics like **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**.  
   - Cached images and JSON data via CDNs to minimize server requests and enhance overall speed.  

3. **User Experience Improvements**:  
   - Addressed and resolved **CLS issues** for a seamless browsing experience with stable layouts during loading.  
   - Designed intuitive and engaging UI components to ensure a smooth shopping flow.  
   - Optimized the site for cross-device compatibility and responsiveness.

The result is a fast, secure, and user-friendly beer shopping site that caters to enthusiasts with optimized browsing and checkout experiences.
